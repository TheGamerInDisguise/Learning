Creating repositories - git init

git status - checks if this is a git file or not

--a - all files

Syncing repositories - origin,pull,push

Parallel development - branch,merge,rebase

Making changes - status,add,commit

git clone - creates a copy of the repository on your local machine

git fork - you create a copy of the repository on your Github account

git config --global user.name "Your Name Here" - sets your name on git 

git config --global user.email "YourEmail@example.com" - sets your email on git

git add --a = stages all files in the folder on git

git commit -m "Message here" = commits all files already staged without opening a text editor but adding a message

git log = shows the log of everything that happened in the repository

rm -rf .git = deletes git repository from git and doesn't delete the folder on your pc

pwd = present working directory

ls = lists all files in folder

cd = command directory

git clone "Link" = copy paste the actual link instead of the "Link" and no quotes needed to install the entire repo in the folder you are working
inside of

git ignores a folder which is blank by default

.gitignore - make a file without a title and instead of .txt , use .gitignore. Now when you insert a name of a file inside of it, it will ignore it from 
the repo but you will have to commit and add this file when you update the files needed to be ignored, to ignore a folder , type "dir/" but replace dir with the name 
of the folder you want to ignore instead

git diff - compares the difference of the files which are named same but are different in staging area along with working directory

git diff --staged - same like git diff but compares between the staging area and the previous commit

git commit -a -m "Text here" - skips staging area and directly commits unstaged files that are already tracked

git rm "file name here" - removes file through terminal and adds so you just need to commit

git mv "original file name" "name to rename the file" - renames file through terminal and adds so you just need to commit

git rm --cached "file name" - untracks file from git

git config --global alias."alias name no quotes needed" 'the thing that is needed to have an alias' - makes an alias for a command that you want to shorten or something

git checkout -b <new-branch-name> - makes branch and does work there

git checkout <branch-name> - changes branch and restores work done there

git branch - shows all branches that you have

git merge <branch name to be merge>  - merges 2 branches in the parent branch you run the command in

git branch -v - To check all branches with their last commit hash code and message

git branch --merged - To check which branch are merged

git branch --no-merged - To check which branch are not merged

git branch -d <branch-name>   - To delete branch

git branch -D <branch-name> - TO delete unmerged branch

git push origin <branch-name> - creates a branch in github which you can push stuff on using git

git push origin <branch-name>:<branch-github-name> - pushes a branch from local to a branch on github or creates one if it doesnt exist

git push -d origin <github-branch> - deletes branch from github entirely
